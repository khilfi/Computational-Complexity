Title: Library Book Borrowing System

2. Whether or not the system should accept the request to borrow books from the library depends on three factors:
    a. Whether or not the visitor is already registered to the system or not
    b. Whether there are outstanding charges on the visitor
    c. Whether the number of borrowed books is below 3 books

3. State transition diagram
    Laccept = {TFF}
    Lreject = {F, TT, TFT}
